/* Highly experiemental PKCS#7 BIO support routines */

/* The usage is quite simple, initialize a PKCS7 structure,
 * get a BIO from it then any data written through the BIO
 * will end up translated to PKCS#7 format on the fly.
 * The data is streamed out and does *not* need to be
 * all held in memory at once.
 *
 * When the BIO is flushed the output is finalized and any
 * signatures etc written out.
 *
 * The BIO is a 'proper' BIO and can handle non blocking I/O
 * correctly.
 *
 * The usage is simple. The implementation is *not*...
