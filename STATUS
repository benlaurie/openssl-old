  OPEN ISSUES

    o  The apps/ dir should be cleaned up. 
       Ralf proposes the following cleanup:
       1. We rename the ssleay program to openssl.
          => This way it's consistent with out project and
             with the already started openssl(1) manpage, etc.
       2. We no longer create such a lot of <command> links for
          "openssl <command>". Instead we follow the "cvs" interface idea
          where all <command>s are called as "cvs <command>".
          => This no longer messes up the install dir with
             symlinks and provides a single-one and consistent command line
             interface. Additionally we can document it nicely with the single
             already started openssl(1) manual page.
       Status: Ralf +1

    o  The installation under "make install" produces a very
       installation layout: $prefix/certs and $prefix/private dirs.  That's
       not nice. Ralf suggests to move the two certs and private dirs either
       to $prefix/etc/, $prefix/lib/ or $prefix/share. Alternatively
       we could also not install the certs at all.

       Status: Ralf +1 for both not installing the certs at all and
                       moving it to $prefix/etc/. +0 for $prefix/lib/
                       and $prefix/share.
               Paul: why is it not nice?
               Ralf: because it messes up the install dir when
                     $prefix is not a dedicated area like /usr/local/ssl.
                     When we move them to a standard subdir like
                     etc/ lib/ or share/ we don't mess up things
                     when $prefix is /usr or /usr/local, etc.
                     Additionally it makes package vendors life
                     easier....

    o  Support for Shared Libraries has to be added at least
       for the major Unix platforms. The details we can rip from the stuff
       Ralf has done for the Apache src/Configure script. Ben wants the
       solution to be really simple.

       Status: Ralf will look how we can easily incorporate the
               compiler PIC and linker DSO flags from Apache
               into the OpenSSL Configure script.

    o  The perl/ stuff needs a major overhaul. Currently it's
       totally obsolete. Either we clean it up and enhance it to be up-to-date
       with the C code or we also could replace it with the really nice
       Net::SSLeay package we can find under
       http://www.neuronio.pt/SSLeay.pm.html.  Ralf uses this package for a
       longer time and it works fine and is a nice Perl module. Best would be
       to convince the author to work for the OpenSSL project and create a
       Net::OpenSSL or Crypt::OpenSSL package out of it and maintains it for
       us.

       Status: Ralf thinks we should both contact the author of Net::SSLeay
               and look how much effort it is to bring Eric's perl/ stuff up
               to date.
               Paul +1

    o  Ralf has ported Stephen's pkcs12 program to OpenSSL (the 
       ASN.1 stuff Eric recently changed :-( ), but needs some help from
       Stephen at two source locations.  Stephen itself also has ported his
       internal pkcs12 0.53 version to OpenSSL, but thinks we still shouldn't
       incorporate it into OpenSSL because it needs more cleanups. Ralf still
       thinks pkcs12 should be incorporated better now than later because it's
       nasty to not have it in the core - one always has to install it
       manually and a lot of people use it. So, should we incorporate it?
       BTW, we have to be carefully because of the pkcs12 license: There are
       some things which don't match the OpenSSL license, so Stephen has to
       change it for us when we want to incorporate the code.

       Status: Ralf +1, Stephen -0
