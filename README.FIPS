Preliminary status and build information for FIPS module v2.0

To build the module do:

./config fipscanisterbuild
make

Build should complete without errors.

Run test suite:

test/fips_test_suite

again should complete without errors.

Run test vectors: 

1. Download an appropriate set of testvectors from www.openssl.org/docs/fips
   those for 2007 are OK.

2. Extract the files to a suitable directory.

3. Run the test vector perl script, for example:

   cd fips
   perl fipsalgtest.pl --dir=/wherever/stuff/was/extracted

4. It should say "passed all tests" at the end. Report full details of any
   failures.

Run:

make clean

to remove any object modules from previous compile.

Run symbol hiding test:

./config fipscanisteronly -DOPENSSL_FIPSSYMS
make

This time only the fips utilities should be built.

Examine the external symbols in fips/fipscanister.o they should all begin
with FIPS or fips. One way to check with GNU nm is:

nm -g --defined-only fips/fipscanister.o | grep -v -i fips

Restricted tarball tests.

The validated module will have its own tarball containing sufficient code to
build fipscanister.o and the associated algorithm tests. You can create a
similar tarball yourself for testing purposes using the commands below.

Standard restricted tarball:

make -f Makefile.fips dist

Prime field field only ECC tarball:

make NOEC2M=1 -f Makefile.fips dist

Once you've created the tarball extract into a fresh directory and do:

./config
make

You can then run the algorithm tests as above. This build automatically uses
fipscanisteronly and -DOPENSSL_FIPSYMS and no-ec2m as appropriate.

Known issues:

Algorithm tests are pre-2011.
The fipslagtest.pl script wont auto run new algorithm tests such as DSA2.
Usage of ECDH/DH needs review and whether any KDFs need to be implemented.
Selftests need updating with larger key sizes in some cases and redundant
tests pruned.
SP800-90 DRBG needs more work: check for compliance, continuous PRNG test
when entropy gathering, periodic health tests.
Some algorithms need to check security strength of PRNG: keygen etc.
No CCM.
No XTS.
The "FIPS capable OpenSSL" is not yet complete: meaning that the rest of
OpenSSL doesn't always use the correct FIPS module APIs and block others
in FIPS mode.
