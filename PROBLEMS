* System libcrypto.dylib and libssl.dylib are used by system ld on MacOS X.
[NOTE: This is currently undergoing tests, and may be removed soon]

This is really a bug in ld, which seems to look for .dylib libraries along
the whole library path before it bothers looking for .a libraries.  This
means that -L switches won't matter unless OpenSSL is built with shared
library support.

The workaround may be to change the following lines in apps/Makefile.ssl and
test/Makefile.ssl:

  LIBCRYPTO=-L.. -lcrypto
  LIBSSL=-L.. -lssl

to:

  LIBCRYPTO=../libcrypto.a
  LIBSSL=../libssl.a

It's possible that something similar is needed for shared library support
as well.  That hasn't been well tested yet.

As long as Apple doesn't fix the problem with ld, this problem building
OpenSSL will remain as is.
