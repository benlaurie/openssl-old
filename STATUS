  RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS

    o [2002-11-21]
      PR 343 mentions that scrubbing memory with 'memset(ptr, 0, n)' may
      be optimized away in modern compilers.  This is definitely not good
      and needs to be fixed immediately.  The formula to use is presented
      in:

      http://online.securityfocus.com/archive/82/297918/2002-10-27/2002-11-02/0

      The problem report that mentions this is:

  AVAILABLE PATCHES

    o 

  IN PROGRESS

    o Steve is currently working on (in no particular order):
        ASN1 code redesign, butchery, replacement.
        OCSP
        EVP cipher enhancement.
        Enhanced certificate chain verification.
	Private key, certificate and CRL API and implementation.
	Developing and bugfixing PKCS#7 (S/MIME code).
        Various X509 issues: character sets, certificate request extensions.
    o Geoff and Richard are currently working on:
	ENGINE (the new code that gives hardware support among others).
    o Richard is currently working on:
	UI (User Interface)
	UTIL (a new set of library functions to support some higher level
	      functionality that is currently missing).
	Shared library support for VMS.
	Kerberos 5 authentication (Heimdal)
	Constification
	Compression
	Attribute Certificate support
	Certificate Pair support
	Storage Engines (primarly an LDAP storage engine)
	Certificate chain validation with full RFC 3280 compatibility

  NEEDS PATCH

    o  0.9.8-dev: COMPLEMENTOFALL and COMPLEMENTOFDEFAULT do not
       handle ECCdraft cipher suites correctly.

    o  apps/ca.c: "Sign the certificate?" - "n" creates empty certificate file

    o  "OpenSSL STATUS" is never up-to-date.

  OPEN ISSUES

    o  The Makefile hierarchy and build mechanism is still not a round thing:

       1. The config vs. Configure scripts
          It's the same nasty situation as for Apache with APACI vs.
          src/Configure. It confuses.
          Suggestion: Merge Configure and config into a single configure
                      script with a Autoconf style interface ;-) and remove
                      Configure and config. Or even let us use GNU Autoconf
                      itself. Then we can avoid a lot of those platform checks
                      which are currently in Configure.

    o  Support for Shared Libraries has to be added at least
       for the major Unix platforms. The details we can rip from the stuff
       Ralf has done for the Apache src/Configure script. Ben wants the
       solution to be really simple.

       Status: Ralf will look how we can easily incorporate the
               compiler PIC and linker DSO flags from Apache
               into the OpenSSL Configure script.

               Ulf: +1 for using GNU autoconf and libtool (but not automake,
                    which apparently is not flexible enough to generate
                    libcrypto)

  WISHES

    o  Add variants of DH_generate_parameters() and BN_generate_prime() [etc?]
       where the callback function can request that the function be aborted.
       [Gregory Stark <ghstark@pobox.com>, <rayyang2000@yahoo.com>]

    o  SRP in TLS.
       [wished by:
        Dj <derek@yo.net>, Tom Wu <tom@arcot.com>,
        Tom Holroyd <tomh@po.crl.go.jp>]

       See http://search.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-tls-srp-00.txt
       as well as http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~tjw/srp/.

       Tom Holroyd tells us there is a SRP patch for OpenSSH at
       http://members.tripod.com/professor_tom/archives/, that could
       be useful.
