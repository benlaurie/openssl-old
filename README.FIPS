Preliminary status and build information for FIPS module v2.0

To build the module do:

./config fipscanisterbuild
make

Build should complete without errors.

Run test suite:

test/fips_test_suite

again should complete without errors.

Run test vectors: 

1. Download an appropriate set of testvectors from www.openssl.org/docs/fips
   those for 2007 are OK.

2. Extract the files to a suitable directory.

3. Run the test vector perl script, for example:

   cd fips
   perl fipsalgtest.pl --dir=/wherever/stuff/was/extracted

4. It should say "passed all tests" at the end. Report full details of any
   failures.

Run symbol hiding test:

./config fipscanisteronly -DOPENSSL_FIPSSYMS
make

This time only the fips utilities should be built.

Examine the external symbols in fips/fipscanister.o they should all begin
with FIPS or fips. One way to check with GNU nm is:

nm -g --defined-only fips/fipscanister.o | grep -v -i fips

Known issues:

Algorithm tests are pre-2011.
The fipslagtest.pl script wont auto run new algorithm tests such as DSA2.
Usage of ECDH/DH needs review and adding appropriate self tests.
Selftests need updating with larger key sizes in some cases and redundant
tests pruned.
SP800-90 DRBG needs more work: health checks, continuous PRNG test,
entropy gathering, security checks in algorithms, add appropriate RAND method
for use by rest of OpenSSL.
No CMAC.
No CCM.
