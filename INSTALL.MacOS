OpenSSL - Port To The Macintosh
===============================

Thanks to Roy Wood <roy@centricsystems.ca> initial support for MacOS (pre
X) is now provided. "Initial" means that unlike other platforms where you
get an SDK and a "swiss army" openssl application, on Macintosh you only
get one sample application which fetches a page over HTTPS(*) and dumps it
in a window. We don't even build the test applications so that we can't
guarantee that all algorithms are operational.

Required software:

- StuffIt Expander	(or any program capable to "unbinhex");
- DropStuff w/EE	(or MacGzip and SUNtar);
- CodeWarrior Pro 5;

Installation procedure:

- fetch the source at ftp://ftp.openssl.org/ (well, you probably already
  did, huh?)
- unpack the .tar.gz file:
	- if you have DropStuff w/EE installed then just drag it over
	  StuffIt Expander;
	- otherwise process it first with MacGzip and then with SUNtar;
- locate MacOS folder in OpenSSL source tree and open it;
- unbinhex mklinks.as.hqx and OpenSSL.mcp.hqx in place;
- double-click on mklinks.as;
- open OpenSSL.mcp and compile 'GetHTTPS PPC' target;
- that's it;

Finally some essential comments from our generous contributor:-)

"I've gotten OpenSSL working on the Macintosh. It's probably a bit of a
hack, but it works for what I'm doing. If you don't like the way I've done
it, then feel free to change what I've done. I freely admit that I've done
some less-than-ideal things in my port, and if you don't like the way I've
done something, then feel free to change it-- I won't be offended!

... I've tweaked "bss_sock.c" a little to call routines in a "MacSocket"
library I wrote. My MacSocket library is a wrapper around OpenTransport,
handling stuff like endpoint creation, reading, writing, etc. It is not
designed as a high-performance package such as you'd use in a webserver,
but is fine for lots of other applications. MacSocket also uses some other
code libraries I've written to deal with string manipulations and error
handling. Feel free to use these things in your own code, but give me
credit and/or send me free stuff in appreciation! :-)
