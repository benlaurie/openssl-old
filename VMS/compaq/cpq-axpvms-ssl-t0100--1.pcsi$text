1 START_INSTRUCTION
=prompt @SYS$STARTUP:SSL$STARTUP.COM should be run at system startup.
Once the installation is complete, adding the following line to
SYS$MANAGER:SYSTARTUP_VMS.COM will define the SSL$ logicals 
in the SYSTEM logical name table:

        $ @SYS$STARTUP:SSL$STARTUP.COM "/SYSTEM"

name tables - EXEC,USER, etc - by replacing the SYSTEM parameter
above with the alternate table name.
