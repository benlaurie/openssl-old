TODO
----

Get a fix on how the paths should be handled. For now, flags == 0
and this is currently just passing strings directly onto the
underlying system calls and letting them do what they want with
the paths. However, it may be desirable to implement flags that
control the way the loading is performed (or attempted), and I
invisage that DSO_ctrl() will be used to control this.

NOTES
-----

I've checked out HPUX (well, version 11 at least) and shl_t is
a pointer type so it's safe to use in the way it has been in
dso_dl.c. On the other hand, HPUX11 support dlfcn too and
according to their man page, prefer developers to move to that.
I'll leave Richard's changes there as I guess dso_dl is needed
for HPUX10.20.

[G-T]
