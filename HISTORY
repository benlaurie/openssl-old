SSLeay 0.8.1 released.

19-Jul-97
	- Server side initated dynamic renegotiation is broken.  I will fix
	  it when I get back from holidays.

15-Jul-97
	- Quite a few small changes.
	- INVALID_SOCKET usage cleanups from Alex Kiernan <alex@hisoft.co.uk>

09-Jul-97
	- Added 2 new values to the SSL info callback.
	  SSL_CB_START which is passed when the SSL protocol is started
	  and SSL_CB_DONE when it has finished sucsessfully.

08-Jul-97
	- Fixed a few bugs problems in apps/req.c and crypto/asn1/x_pkey.c
	  that related to DSA public/private keys.
	- Added all the relevent PEM and normal IO functions to support
	  reading and writing RSAPublic keys.
	- Changed makefiles to use ${AR} instead of 'ar r'

07-Jul-97
	- Error in ERR_remove_state() that would leave a dangling reference
	  to a free()ed location - thanks to Alex Kiernan <alex@hisoft.co.uk>
	- s_client now prints the X509_NAMEs passed from the server
	  when requesting a client cert.
	- Added a ssl->type, which is one of SSL_ST_CONNECT or
	  SSL_ST_ACCEPT.  I had to add it so I could tell if I was
	  a connect or an accept after the handshake had finished.
	- SSL_get_client_CA_list(SSL *s) now returns the CA names
	  passed by the server if called by a client side SSL.

05-Jul-97
	- Bug in X509_NAME_get_text_by_OBJ(), looking starting at index
	  0, not -1 :-(  Fix from Tim Hudson (tjh@cryptsoft.com).

04-Jul-97
	- Fixed some things in X509_NAME_add_entry(), thanks to
	  Matthew Donald <matthew@world.net>.
	- I had a look at the cipher section and though that it was a
	  bit confused, so I've changed it.
	- I was not setting up the RC4-64-MD5 cipher correctly.  It is
	  a MS special that appears in exported MS Money.
	- Error in all my DH ciphers.  Section 7.6.7.3 of the SSLv3
	  spec.  I was missing the two byte length header for the
	  ClientDiffieHellmanPublic value.  This is a packet sent from
	  the client to the server.  The SSL_OP_SSLEAY_080_CLIENT_DH_BUG
	  option will enable SSLeay server side SSLv3 accept either
	  the correct or my 080 packet format.
	- Fixed a few typos in crypto/pem.org.

02-Jul-97
	- Alias mapping for EVP_get_(digest|cipher)byname is now
	  performed before a lookup for actual cipher.  This means
	  that an alias can be used to 're-direct' a cipher or a
	  digest.
	- ASN1_read_bio() had a bug that only showed up when using a
	  memory BIO.  When EOF is reached in the memory BIO, it is
	  reported as a -1 with BIO_should_retry() set to true.

01-Jul-97
	- Fixed an error in X509_verify_cert() caused by my
	  miss-understanding how 'do { contine } while(0);' works.
	  Thanks to Emil Sit <sit@mit.edu> for educating me :-)

30-Jun-97
	- Base64 decoding error.  If the last data line did not end with
	  a '=', sometimes extra data would be returned.
	- Another 'cut and paste' bug in x509.c related to setting up the
	  STDout BIO.

27-Jun-97
	- apps/ciphers.c was not printing due to an editing error.
	- Alex Kiernan <alex@hisoft.co.uk> send in a nice fix for
	  a library build error in util/mk1mf.pl

26-Jun-97
	- Still did not have the auto 'experimental' code removal
	  script correct.
	- A few header tweaks for Watcom 11.0 under Win32 from
	  Rolf Lindemann <Lindemann@maz-hh.de>
	- 0 length OCTET_STRING bug in asn1_parse
	- A minor fix with an non-existent function in the MS .def files.
	- A few changes to the PKCS7 stuff.

25-Jun-97
	SSLeay 0.8.0 finally it gets released.

24-Jun-97
	Added a SSL_OP_EPHEMERAL_RSA option which causes all SSLv3 RSA keys to
	use a temporary RSA key.  This is experimental and needs some more work.
	Fixed a few Win16 build problems.

23-Jun-97
	SSLv3 bug. I was not doing the 'lookup' of the CERT structure
	correctly. I was taking the SSL->ctx->default_cert when I should
	have been using SSL->cert. The bug was in ssl/s3_srvr.c

20-Jun-97
	X509_ATTRIBUTES were being encoded wrongly by apps/reg.c and the
	rest of the library. Even though I had the code required to do
	it correctly, apps/req.c was doing the wrong thing.  I have fixed
	and tested everything.

	Missing a few #ifdef FIONBIO sections in crypto/bio/bss_acpt.c.

19-Jun-97
	Fixed a bug in the SSLv2 server side first packet handling. When
	using the non-blocking test BIO, the ssl->s2->first_packet flag
	was being reset when a would-block failure occurred when reading
	the first 5 bytes of the first packet. This caused the checking
	logic to run at the wrong time and cause an error.

	Fixed a problem with specifying cipher. If RC4-MD5 were used,
	only the SSLv3 version would be picked up.  Now this will pick
	up both SSLv2 and SSLv3 versions. This required changing the
	SSL_CIPHER->mask values so that they only mask the ciphers,
	digests, authentication, export type and key-exchange algorithms.

	I found that when a SSLv23 session is established, a reused
	session, of type SSLv3 was attempting to write the SSLv2 
	ciphers, which were invalid. The SSL_METHOD->put_cipher_by_char 
	method has been modified so it will only write out cipher which
	that method knows about.
